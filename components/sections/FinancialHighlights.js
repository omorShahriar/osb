                      The bank experienced another year of strong growth in
                      2021. Total Assets grew $77 million, or 15 percent. This
                      strong asset growth was driven by growth in deposits of
                      $75 million, or 17%. Like much of the banking industry, a
                      significant amount of our growth was due to the strong
                      inflow of funds from government stimulus money, as well as
                      the higher savings rates of consumers and businesses. Low
                      cost demand deposits grew over $41 million. In 2021, we
                      continued to focus heavily on expanding the deposit
                      relationship of our existing and prospective customers to
                      ensure the bank is their primary financial institution.

                      Total loans decreased $26 million or 7 percent. However,
                      excluding the effect of loan pay downs from Paycheck
                      Protection Program (PPP) forgiveness payments during 2021,
                      loans increased $29.9 million, or 9.4%.

                    <p>
                      Our credit quality remains strong. Our owner-occupied
                      commercial real estate portfolio, which represents one of
                      the safer segments of our loan portfolio, continued to
                      grow in 2021. Past dues remained extremely low and were
                      only 0.11% of loan balances at 12/31/21. We were able to
                      reduce the amount of our loan loss provision with $456,000
                      booked in 2021, compared to $1.25 million for 2020. 2020’s
                      loan loss provision reflected potential risks from the
                      COVID-19 virus. For 2021, our loan recoveries, net of loan
                      charge offs were only $29,000.

                      Oconee State Bank and Oconee Financial Corporation’s
                      results for 2021 reflect a significant improvement over
                      2020 and reflect the dedication and quality work of our
                      team. Despite historically low net interest margins, we
                      are pleased to report 2021 net income of $3.0 million
                      versus $1.9 million in 2020. On a pre-tax basis, 2021
                      includes PPP fee income of $2.2 million vs $1.0 million of
                      PPP fee income recognized in 2020.

                      Oconee State Bank provided $56 million in PPP funding to
                      638 customers in 2020 and another $18 million in funding
                      to 232 customers in 2021. As of 12/31/21, the bank has
                      received $69.7 million from the U.S. Small Business
                      Administration for loans forgiven. These PPP loans
                      provided cash flow assistance to businesses who were
                      affected by economic conditions as a result of COVID-19.

                      share in April of 2021, an increase of 8 percent over the

                      from $42.56 to $43.88, an increase of 3 percent. We are
