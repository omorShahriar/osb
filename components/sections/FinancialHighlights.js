                      Oconee State Bank and Oconee Financial Corporation&#39;s
                      results for 2021 reflect a significant improvement over
                      2020 and reflect the dedication and quality work of our
                      team. Despite historically low net interest margins, we
                      are pleased to report 2021 net income of $3.0 million
                      versus $1.9 million in 2020. On a pre-tax basis, 2021
                      includes PPP fee income of $2.2 million vs $1.0 million of
                      PPP fee income recognized in 2020. Oconee State Bank
                      provided $56 million in PPP funding to 638 customers in
                      2020 and another $18 million in funding to 232 customers
                      in 2021. As of 12/31/21, the Bank has received $70 million
                      from the U.S. Small Business Administration for loans
                      forgiven. These PPP loans provided cash flow assistance to
                      businesses who were affected by economic conditions as a
                      result of COVID-19. Oconee Financial Corporation paid a
                      dividend of $0.65 per share in April of 2021, an increase
                      of 8 percent over the prior year dividend. Our book value
                      per share increased from $42.56 to $43.88, an increase of
                      3 percent. We are pleased to report that the Board of
                      Directors voted to increase the 2022 annual dividend to
                      $0.70 per share, an increase of 8 percent. This dividend
                      increase mirrors our growth and overall financial
                      strength. Oconee Financial Corporation&#39;s stock, which
                      trades on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol
                      &ldquo;OSBK,&rdquo; increased from $36.25 per share at
                      year-end 2020 to $44.00 per share at year-end 2021. This
                      represents an increase of 21 percent

                      The Bank experienced another year of strong growth in
                      2021. Total Assets grew $77 million, or 15 percent. This
                      strong asset growth was driven by growth in deposits of
                      $75 million, or 17%. Like much of the banking industry, a
                      significant amount of our growth was due to the strong
                      inflow of funds from government stimulus money, as well as
                      the higher savings rates of consumers and businesses. Low
                      cost demand deposits grew over $41 million. In 2021, we
                      continued to focus heavily on expanding the deposit
                      relationship of our existing and prospective customers to
                      ensure the Oconee State Bank is their primary financial
                      institution.

                      Total loans decreased $26 million or 7%. However,
                      excluding the effect of loan paydowns from Paycheck
                      Protection Program (PPP) forgiveness payments during 2021,
                      loans increased $25.2 million, or 9.2%. Our owner-occupied
                      commercial real estate portfolio, which represents one of
                      the safer segments of our loan portfolio, continued to
                      grow in 2021. Past dues remained extremely low and were
                      only 0.11% of loan balances at 12/31/21. We were able to
                      reduce the amount of our loan loss provision with $456,000
                      booked in 2021, compared to $1.25 million for 2020.
                      2020&#39;s loan loss provision reflected potential risks
                      from the COVID-19 virus. For 2021, our loan recoveries,
                      net of loan charge offs were only $29,000.
