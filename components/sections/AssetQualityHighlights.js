                <p>
                  In 2021 the Bank continued to assist small businesses through
                  an additional $18 Million of 2021 SBA Paycheck Protection
                  Program (PPP) Loans and guiding them through $71 Million in
                  loan forgiveness. Excluding these PPP loan efforts, the Bank
                  continued to grow its targeted Owner Occupied Commercial Real
                  Estate Portfolio to 38% of the Total Loan Portfolio.
                  Additionally, the Bank continues to demonstrate a
                  well-balanced and diversified loan portfolio mix with 27% of
                  the portfolio in Non-Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate,
                  and 16% of the portfolio in 1 to 4 Family Housing loans.
