                    “As a team, we have grown leaps and bounds over the last
                    year. We have successfully managed a loan portfolio of
                    nearly $108 million, generating $32 million in new loan
                    production for the year. Together we helped the bank
                    navigate round two of Paycheck Protection Plan loans of $18
                    million, and $71 million in forgiveness. We are proud to say
                    that the OC Market Retail team exceeded budget and we
                    continue to add new team members that hold true to our
                    mission and values. We are looking forward to a great

                    “The Gwinnett Team had a great 2021 with many
                    accomplishments. We moved into our new permanent location in
                    Duluth, Georgia. The new space will be our home for many
                    years to come that provides the needed room to expand the
                    team and offer a great place for our clients to visit. The
                    Gwinnett Team worked extremely hard in 2021 and their
                    efforts rewarded the bank with a profit and successfully
                    exceeding the budget. We have added new team members and
                    together have put forth continued efforts to increase
                    awareness of the OSB brand. I would like to offer a special
                    thank you to all of our shareholders, without you, this
                    would not be possible. The Gwinnett Team is up to the
                    challenge and we look forward to reporting our successes in
                    2022.”
